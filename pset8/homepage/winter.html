            <h1 class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">Winter: The Coldest Season</h1>
            <img src="winter1.jpg" alt="winter" class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">Winter, the coldest season of the year, comes between autumn and spring. It is associated with plunging temperatures and icy weather, but its impact and timing change according to location. The farther an area lies from the equator, the colder temperatures it experiences. Temperatures in equatorial regions stay relatively constant despite the shifting seasons. This is because, due to the curve of the Earth, the equatorial areas get more sunlight, according to the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program.</p>
            <h2 class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">Shifting time frames</h2>
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">Most people think the coldest season begins during the winter solstice, but there are in fact two definitions of winter</p>
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">Astronomical winter — what most people think of as winter — is defined by Earth's position around the sun and ranges from the winter solstice to the vernal equinox. The winter solstice marks the time when sun passes directly over the equator. In the Northern Hemisphere, it falls around December 21, and in the Southern Hemisphere it occurs around June 21, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). It is the shortest day of the year, and has been noted and celebrated by a wide variety of cultures around the world. [Gallery: Images of Stunning Snowy Landscapes]</p>
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">At the time of the winter solstice, the corresponding pole is tipped about 23.5 degrees away from the sun, according to the NWS. On that day in the Northern Hemisphere, the North Pole is farther from the heat-producing star, while the Southern Hemisphere, which experiences summer, is closer. </p>
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">But anyone who regularly engages in winter sports might tell you that winter weather tends to fall before the middle of December or June. Meteorological winter falls sooner, spanning the three-month period from December to March, according to NOAA. It is based on the annual temperature cycle and the calendar rather than Earth's journey around the sun. </p>
            <h2 class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">Winter in the hemispheres</h2>
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">People living in the Northern Hemisphere are more likely to experience a colder winter than those in the Southern Hemisphere. In fact, all of the coldest countries in the world are located in the Northern Hemisphere. These include Kazakhstan, Russia, Greenland, Canada, the United States, Iceland, Finland, Estonia and Mongolia, according to Earth & World. (Though not a country, Antarctica, in the Southern Hemisphere, is technically the coldest region on Earth.)</p>
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">So why do so many countries in the Northern Hemisphere get much colder than those in the Southern Hemisphere? This occurs because there are a few major differences between the two hemispheres when it comes to factors that affect climate: the size of a land mass, how close the land is to a polar region and the amount of ocean coverage. </p>
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">First, there are larger masses of land at higher latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, even within the Arctic Circle, such as Greenland, the northern parts of Norway, Sweden, Finland and Iceland and the frigid tundras of North America, Europe and Asia. In contrast, the bigger land masses in the Southern Hemisphere are closer to the equator and no countries are located on or below the Antarctic Circle — only the frozen unpopulated continent of Antarctica</p>
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">Another important temperature moderator is the ocean. Oceans cover 81 percent of the Southern Hemisphere, compared to only 61 percent in the Northern Hemisphere, according to the book "Atmospheric Temperature Profiles of the Northern Hemisphere" (Springer, 2012). All of this water, which stores and conducts heat better than land, helps keep temperatures somewhat warmer and more stable. </p>
            <h2 class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">Adapting to the weather</h2>
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">Winter brings many changes to the world around it. During winter, some animals migrate, which means moving to another area for a season's time. Usually, animals go south to warmer areas during the winter. In response to global warming, some bird species now arrive in spring breeding grounds earlier, and lay eggs earlier, according to a report by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). In Europe, some birds that normally migrate have stopped migrating altogether, according to the report. </p>
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">Species movement has to do with changes in habitat, as well, Keith Peterman, a professor of chemistry at York College of Pennsylvania, and Gregory Foy, an associate professor of chemistry at York College of Pennsylvania, explained to Live Science. Migration isn't just about staying warm. Animals can be forced out of their normal habitat because of changes in their food supply and introduction of new bacteria or viruses (due to the change in climate) where they have poor resistance.</p>
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">Others animals begin a period of hibernation during the winter, passing much of the season in a near-sleep state. Because many plants die or are dormant, animals may stockpile food to help them through periods of want.</p>
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">In addition to changing their locations and habits, some animals may also change their appearance. Animals such as hares and foxes may change their coloration to blend into snowy landscapes better. For example, the snowshoe hair is brown during warm months, but then turns white to blend in with the snow, according to National Geographic. Other animals might grow thicker fur to help them to stay warm.</p>
            <h2 class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">Staying warm</h2>
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">Cold winters can quickly bring on life-threatening medical conditions, such as hypothermia. Hypothermia is when a human's body temperature drops below 95 F (35 C), according to the Mayo Clinic. Cold temperatures and wind chill can make a person's body temperature drop in just minutes.</p>
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">The cold temperatures can also cause frostbite, the freezing of skin and tissue. Cold temperatures are just one factor when it comes to frostbite susceptibility. "Other factors also come into play including the age/size of the individual (e.g., quicker onset in small children) or if an individual has less than optimal circulation to distal body parts such as hands/finger/feet/toes," said Dr. Nicholas Lorenzo, the chief medical officer with MeMD, a web-based health services provider. </p>
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">To avoid hypothermia and frostbite, it is important to keep all skin covered and dry during cold weather. Once a person has hypothermia or frostbite, the primary treatment is rewarming the patient.</p>

            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">"Now is the winter of our discontent." — William Shakespeare</p>
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">"If winter comes, can spring be far behind?" ― Percy Bysshe Shelley</p>
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">"Winter is the time for comfort, for good food and warmth, for the touch of a friendly hand and for a talk beside the fire: it is the time for home." ― Edith Sitwell</p>
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">"Winter is nature's way of saying, 'Up yours.'" ― Robert Byrne</p>
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">"Winter is not a season, it's an occupation." ― Sinclair Lewis</p>
