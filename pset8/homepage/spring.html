            <h1 class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">Spring: Season of New Beginnings</h1>
            <img src="spring1.jpg" alt="spring" class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">Spring is the season of new beginnings. Fresh buds bloom, animals awaken and the earth seems to come to life again. Farmers and gardeners plant their seeds and temperatures slowly rise. The timing of these changes varies depending upon location.</p>
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">What most people call spring relies on the astronomical definition of the word. Spring is generally considered the period between the spring equinox and the summer solstice. Defined by the angle of Earth's tilt toward the sun, astronomical spring relies on equinoxes and solstices to define it.</p>
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">Equinoxes are special days during the year when day and night are almost equal. There are two equinoxes, one in the spring and one in the fall. The spring, or vernal, equinox occurs around March 20 in the Northern Hemisphere and around September 22 in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">The air may lose its winter chill before the middle of March or September, though. Weather forecasters define meteorological spring as a three-month period based on rising temperatures. North of the equator, meteorological spring takes place in March, April and May, while in the south it is characterized by the months of September, October and November, according to NOAA.</p>
            <h2 class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">A time of celebration</h2>
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">Many cultures celebrate the return of spring, the blossoming of nature or the rise of the vernal equinox.</p>
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">In Japan, the annual blossoming of cherry trees has become a significant national event. Hanami, or cherry blossom viewing, is a time for festivals and gatherings at parks and shrines, according to the Japan National Tourism Organization. Cherry blossoms, or sakura, symbolize the transience of life, which is a major theme in Buddhism.</p>
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">Mayday celebrations are common around Europe. The Maypole dance is a popular folk festival, particularly in parts of Germany and the United Kingdom. "The pole symbolizes sacred trees, the world axis, the phallus, growth and regeneration," said De Rossi.</p>
            <h2 class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">Spring quotes</h2>
