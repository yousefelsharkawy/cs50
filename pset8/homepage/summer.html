            <img class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6" src="summer1.jpg" alt="summer">
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">Warm weather, swimming and vacations â€” such events often herald the arrival of summer. Most people mistakenly believe that the season starts with the dawn of the summer solstice, but there are actually two definitions of summer. Let's take a look at the hottest time of the year.</p>
            <h2 class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">A Matter of Definition</h2>
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">Summer is the warmest season of the year, falling between spring and autumn. Temperatures over the period differ based upon the location on the Earth; regions near the equator are typically warmer than those lying near the poles. This is because, due to the curve of the Earth, these places receive the most sunlight, according to Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program. The areas around the Earth's poles also have ice, which reflect a lot of the sun's rays.</p>
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">The summer equinox occurs when the sun passes directly above the equator because of the tilt of the Earth. When the seasons are based on the Earth's position in relation to the sun, it is called astronomical summer. In the Northern Hemisphere, astronomical summer happens on or around June 21. The North Pole is tilted at the greatest angle toward the sun at this time. In the Southern Hemisphere, summer occurs on or around December 22, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), when the South Pole is tilted toward the sun.</p>
            <h2 class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">Temperatures rising</h2>
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">Weather in the summer grows warmer, and in some areas, the heat translates to drier temperatures. This hot, dry time of year can lead to droughts, where water is in short supply. Heat waves, times of excessively hot weather that include spikes in temperature, can also occur during the summer. Both can create a number of problems for people and wildlife.</p>
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">However, in many tropical regions, summer is the time of the "wet season," which is defined as a month where average precipitation is 60 millimeters (2.4 inches) or more, according to the British Broadcasting Company (BBC). Vegetative growth increases during this time period. If winds are changing, the increased rainfall can also usher in monsoon season, a time of violent rainy storms.</p>
            <h2 class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">Avoid dehydration</h2>
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">Many summer deaths are caused by dehydration, especially during heat waves. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has found that heat waves are the deadliest extreme weather events in the United States. Staying hydrated is especially important when temperatures soar. The National Academy of Science's Food and Nutrition Board recommends that women consume 91 ounces (2.7 liters) of water daily and men consume 125 oz. (3.7 liters). People doing vigorous exercise should drink even more.</p>
