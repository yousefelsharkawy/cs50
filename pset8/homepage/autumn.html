            <h1 class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">Autumn: The Cooling-Off Season</h1>
            <img src="autumn1.jpg" alt="autumn" class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">Sandwiched between blazing summer and chilly winter, autumn is the "cooling off" season. Nighttime arrives earlier, temperatures begin to drop and most vegetative growth decreases. Animals begin to prepare for the dearth of food that generally comes during the winter, gathering supplies or traveling to warmer climates.</p>
            <h2 class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">Seasons explained</h2>
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">The cycle of seasons is caused by Earth's tilt on its axis and the planet's orbit around the sun. When the axis points toward the sun, that hemisphere experiences summer. The hemisphere tilted away from the sun experiences winter. After Earth travels a quarter of the way around the sun, the axis is pointed along the planet's path, parallel to the star. </p>
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">From our perspective here on Earth, the sun travels along an imaginary line called the ecliptic, which marks the plane in which the planets orbit the sun. Another imaginary line is the celestial equator, which a projection of Earth's equator into space. For half the year, during summer in the Northern Hemisphere, the sun appears to move along the ecliptic north of the celestial equator. During the other half of the year, it appears to be south of the celestial equator. </p>
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">Day and night are not exactly 12 hours each. Because of the way the sun's light refracts in Earth's atmosphere, we can actually see the sun for a few minutes before its disk rises and for a few minutes after it has truly set. Thus, daylight on any given day lasts roughly six or seven minutes longer than it seemingly should. [Earth's Equinoxes & Solstices (Infographic)]</p>
            <h2 class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">Different definitions of autumn</h2>
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">The autumnal equinox is the beginning of "astronomical autumn," which ends with the start of winter. In the Northern Hemisphere, that is from around September 22 to about December 22, though it varies from year to year, according to the NOAA. In the Southern Hemisphere, the season runs from about March 20 to June 21. </p>
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">Weather forecasters and some countries define the season as "meteorological autumn" by the three months in which the weather changes. In the Northern Hemisphere, this is September, October, and November. In the Southern Hemisphere, meteorological autumn occurs in March, April, and May.</p>
            <h2 class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">Falling temperatures</h2>
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">Autumn brings a nip in the air. How much of a change is felt depends on the location of the area on Earth. Regions near the equator experience fairly constant temperatures throughout the year, while those farther north or south experience greater variations. This is because the equator gets a consistent amount of sun. Far northern and southern regions get less sun due to the curvature of the sun, according to the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program.</p>
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">For the continental United States, temperatures during autumn (September through November) average 53.5 degrees Fahrenheit (11.9 Celsius), according to the NOAA — an 18-degree (10 degrees C) drop from average summer temperatures. Average autumn temperatures range from a high of 72.7 F (22.6 C) in Florida to a low of 26.7 F (minus 2.9 C) in Alaska.</p>
            <h2 class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">Why do leaves change color?</h2>
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">In response to chilly temperatures and the changes in daylight, leaves stop producing green-tinted chlorophyll, which allows them to capture sunlight and make energy. Because chlorophyll is sensitive to the cold, certain weather conditions like early frosts will turn off production more quickly.</p>
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">Meanwhile, orange and yellow pigments called carotenoids — also found in orange carrots — shine through the leaves' washed out green. The red color in some leaves comes from anthocyanins, which unlike carotenoids, are only produced in the fall, according to the State University of New York College of Environment. They also give color to strawberries, red apples, and plums. </p>
            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">But red leaves are also signal of distress. If you see leaves of a tree turning red early, in late August, the tree is most likely suffering from a fungus or perhaps a ding from a reckless driver. </p>
